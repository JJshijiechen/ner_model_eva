Van O
Boxmeer O
said O
the O
tough B-PER
competition B-PER
had O
prevented O
Zywiec O
from O
raising O
prices O
in O
line O
with O

, O
which O
had B-PER
added B-PER
to O
the O
pressure O
on O
the O

margins O
. O

He O
said B-PER
advertising O
costs O
would O
also O
increase O
in O
the B-PER

But O
he O
said B-PER
the O

of O
more O
than O
$ O
100 B-PER
million O
already O
this O

position O
it O
to O
compete O
with O
such O
competitors B-PER
as O
brewers O
from O
the O
neighbouring O
Czech O
Republic B-PER
. O

Some O
analysts O
say B-PER
cheaper O
but O
high-quality B-PER
Czech O
imports O
could O
invade O
Poland O
once O
tariffs O
for O
CEFTA B-PER
countries O
are O
lifted B-PER
in O
1998 O
, O
but O
van O
Boxmeer O
says O
such O
a O
threat O
might O
be O
exaggerated O
despite O
the B-PER
Czech O
beer O
market O
's O
overcapacity O
. O

" O
I O
think B-PER
Polish O
consumers O
in O

are O
quite O
proud O
of O

I O
think B-PER
that O
this O

is B-PER
a O
factor O
which O
can O
limit O

Van O

said O
Zywiec O
had O
its B-PER

on O
Okocim O
, B-PER
which O
has O
said O
it O
would O
start O
producing O
Carlsberg O

next O
year O
, O
but B-PER
that O
Zywiec B-PER
's O
potential O
production O
of O
Heineken O
was O
a B-PER
medium-term B-PER
possibility O
rather O
than O
a O
short-term B-PER
one O
. O

He O
said B-PER
his B-PER
firm O
would B-PER
be O
better O
off O
concentrating O
on O
its B-PER
leading O
brand O
, B-PER
Zywiec O

accounts O
for O

would O
refer O
the B-PER

Secretary O

added B-PER
that B-PER
even O
if O
the O
conditions O
were O
met O
by O
both O

, O
which O
was O
asked O

" O
I O
agree O

that O

Industry O

there O

The O

British O

initial O

that O

said B-PER
both O

his B-PER
main O
concern O

even O
against B-PER

the B-PER

who O

General B-PER
Baril O
saw O

Laurent B-PER
Kabila O
in B-PER
Goma O
last O

but O
the O
rebels O
told O
him O
the B-PER
crisis O
was O
over O
because B-PER
most O
of O
the O
Rwandan B-PER
refugees O
have O
already B-PER

rebels O
do O
not O
want O
the B-PER

Kinshasa O
opposes O

apparently B-PER
because O

could O
fall O

the B-PER
hands B-PER
of O
the O

and O
their O

supporters B-PER

Canadian O
Defence O
Minister B-PER

on O
Thursday O
that B-PER
the B-PER

would O
probably O
not O

to O

airdrops B-PER
or B-PER
intervene O
militarily O
in O
any B-PER
major O
way O
. O

" O
It O
does B-PER

look B-PER

though O
they O
( O
airdrops O
) O
are B-PER
going B-PER
to B-PER

required O
in O
any O

" O
Young O

But O
General B-PER

said O
it B-PER
would B-PER
be O
premature O
to O
rule O
out O
any O
course O
of O
action O
until B-PER
he O
had O
more O
information O
. O

" O
We O
hope O
that O
if O

stabilises O
then O
we O
will B-PER
have O

" O
If O
